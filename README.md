# 👋 Hi, I'm Kehinde Ojo

**Data & Financial Analyst** | *I use data to solve business challenges, not just visualize them.*

With a solid background in finance and a sharp analytical mindset, I focus on identifying inefficiencies, uncovering trends, and guiding better decisions. I use tools like **Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python** to answer the question: *"What’s really happening—and what should we do about it?"*
